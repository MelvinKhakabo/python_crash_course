Welcome to python!
In this course, youâ€™ll go from writing your first line of code to building cool projects thatâ€™ll make you say, â€˜Wow, I did that! ðŸ˜Žâ€™Â 
Whether youâ€™re totally new to coding or just looking to sharpen your Python skills, get ready for an epic journey filled with coding magic, challenges, and lots of fun moments.Â 

Python Language Quick Overview
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for many different purposes, from web development to scientific computing to machine learning.Â 

There are several reasons why Python is a great choice for many different types of projects:
Easy to learn: Python has a relatively simple syntax, which makes it easier for beginners to learn compared to other programming languages.
Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
Large and active community: There is a large and active community of Python developers, which means that there are many resources available for learning and solving problems.
Plenty of libraries: Python has a large number of libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which can be used to perform complex tasks with just a few lines of code.
Cross-platform compatibility: Python can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a good choice for projects that need to be run on multiple platforms.


Install Python
If you don't want to use Thonny, here's how to install and run Python on your computer.
Download the latest version of Python.
Run the installer file and follow the steps to install Python
During the installation process, check Add Python to environment variables. This will add Python to environment variables, and you can run Python from any part of the computer.
Also, you can choose the path where Python is installed.
Note: For Unix based Operating Systems like Linux and macOS systems have Python pre-installed

Install Your Own code editor
You might want to use VScode: 
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular code editor that provides tools and extensions for developing applications. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you get started with using VS Code:

1. Download and Install VS Code
Download: Go to the official Visual Studio Code website.
Install: Run the installer and follow the installation steps for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Open VS Code
Launch the application by clicking on the VS Code icon or typing "Code" in your command prompt/terminal.
3. Familiarize Yourself with the User Interface
Activity Bar: The left-hand sidebar contains icons for:
Explorer: Browse and manage files and folders.
Search: Perform text searches in files.
Source Control: Interface for version control (e.g., Git).
Extensions: Install and manage extensions.
Debugger: Start and control your debugging sessions.
Editor Area: The main space where you edit files.
Status Bar: Shows information about your current project, such as language mode, errors, etc.
Terminal: You can open an integrated terminal by clicking Terminal > New Terminal.
4. Open a Project or Folder
Click on File > Open Folder... and select the folder containing your project files. This makes it easier to browse and edit your files directly from the editor.
5. Create or Open a File
Use the Explorer on the left to create a new file by clicking the "New File" icon.
Alternatively, open an existing file by clicking it.
6. Install Extensions (Optional but Recommended)
Click on the Extensions icon (left sidebar).
Browse or search for extensions to enhance the capabilities of VS Code.
Examples:
Python for Python support.
ESLint for JavaScript linting.
Prettier for code formatting.
Click Install on any desired extension.
7. Select a Language Mode (If Needed)
By default, VS Code tries to detect the language of the file based on its extension.
To change it manually, click on the language identifier in the bottom-right corner of the status bar and select the language mode.
8. Basic File Operations
Save File: Ctrl + S (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + S (macOS).
Open New Tab: Ctrl + N or Cmd + N.
Close File: Ctrl + W or Cmd + W.
9. Editing and Writing Code
Autocomplete: Start typing, and VS Code suggests code completion options.
Syntax Highlighting: Automatically color-codes your code for easier reading.
Snippets: Use predefined code templates for faster coding (you can also create custom snippets).
10. Run Code
For simple code snippets:
Install an extension like Code Runner.
Use Ctrl + Alt + N or click on the play icon to run code in the integrated terminal.
For more complex applications:
Use the integrated terminal (Terminal > New Terminal) to run commands.
Use debugging by configuring a launch.json file (for Node.js, Python, etc.).
11. Debugging (Optional)
Click the Run and Debug icon on the sidebar or press F5.
Configure breakpoints, watch variables, and step through code for detailed debugging.
Adjust settings in the launch.json file.
12. Using Version Control (e.g., Git)
Initialize a Git repository in your project folder (if not already).
Stage changes, commit, push, and pull from the built-in source control panel.
Use the Source Control icon to manage your changes easily.
13. Customize Settings and Themes
Settings: Go to File > Preferences > Settings (Windows/Linux) or Code > Preferences > Settings (macOS).
Theme: Go to File > Preferences > Color Theme to change the appearance.
14. Use Shortcuts for Productivity
Command Palette: Press Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + P (macOS) to open and search for any action.
Comment Lines: Ctrl + / or Cmd + /.
Navigate Between Files: Ctrl + P or Cmd + P.
15. Troubleshooting and Help
Access the built-in documentation by clicking Help > Welcome.
Use online resources and communities like Stack Overflow or the VS Code documentation.
With these steps, youâ€™re on your way to becoming proficient in using VS Code! Start experimenting with small projects and progressively explore more features as needed.

You are all set!
And as a gesture of goodluck, try printing the basic python code to get you started.
Try code: print("Hello, World!)

Summary
In this chapter you learned a bit about Python in general, and you installed 
Python to your system if it wasnâ€™t already there. You also installed a text editor to make it easier to write Python code. You learned to run snippets of 
Python code in a terminal session, and you ran your first actual program, 
hello_world.py. You probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
In the next chapter youâ€™ll learn about the different kinds of data you 
can work with in your Python programs, and youâ€™ll learn to use variables 
as well.
